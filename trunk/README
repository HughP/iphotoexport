iphotoexport allows you to export and synchronize your iPhoto library to a 
folder tree. It preserves both the original and modified image, your event 
and album organization, and applies your iPhoto titles, descriptions, 
keywords, and face tags to the IPTC/EXIF metadata of your images. You can
export a full copy of your library, or just build a tree of linked images
that require very little additional disk space. You can re-run iphotoexport
at any time to synchronize any changes made in iPhoto to your export tree
quickly. iphotoexport works well with file-system based photo management
tools like Picasa or Adobe Bridge.

iphotoexport is written in Python, and can easily be customized.
