**iphotoexport has been replaced by [Phoshare](http://code.google.com/p/phoshare)**. Phoshare includes all the functionality of iphotoexport, but is a real Mac OSX application, and also exports face rectangles.

iphotoexport allows you to export and synchronize your iPhoto library to a folder tree. It preserves both the original and modified image, your event and album organization, and applies your iPhoto titles, descriptions, keywords, face tags, places, and ratings to the IPTC/EXIF metadata of your images. You can export a full copy of your library, or just build a tree of linked images that require very little additional disk space. You can re-run iphotoexport at any time to synchronize any changes made in iPhoto to your export tree quickly. iphotoexport works well with file-system based photo management tools like Picasa or Adobe Bridge.

iphotoexport is written in Python, and is easily customizable.
